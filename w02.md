# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Are Macs REALLY Safer?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIPMndlTqA)<br>
From this video, I conclude that MacOS is actually safer because of the lower number of hackers on the platform.
From my 10 years experience using Windows and 6 years experience using MacOS, I would say MacOS does better at restricting it's user from accessing unsafe websites, especially the older versions.
Windows' security settings can easily changed by most user when on the other hand MacOS's security settings needs a bit of GSGS for most user.

2. [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)<br>
You're most likely have heard about this website at some point, you can check if your email ever been involved in any data breach.
Overall a cool and unique website, a little nerve-wracking, good to scare boomers.
I use this website when I saw a news about [Tokopedia data breach](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/05/04/tokopedia-data-breach-exposes-vulnerability-of-personal-data.html), unfortunately my email is involved in this event.

3. [15 Alarming Cyber Security Facts and Stats](https://www.cybintsolutions.com/cyber-security-facts-stats/#:~:text=43%25%20of%20cyber%20attacks%20target%20small%20business&text=62%25%20experienced%20phishing%20%26%20social%20engineering,of%20%247.68%20million%20per%20incident.)<br>
As the title says, this article shows jaw-dropping statistics about cyber security.
Most interesting facts for me are number 3 and 12 that shows hackers likes small business and a lot of companies have no concern about this topic.

4. [The Difference Between Encryption, Hashing, and Salting](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/difference-encryption-hashing-salting/)<br>
This article is very detailed despite being very long.
For those who don't want to read, TL;DR: encryption is two-way algorithm meant to protect data in transit, hashing is one-way algorithm meant to verify data, and salting is adding "salt" before encryption and commonly used for passwords.

5. [Google Data Center Security: 6 Layers Deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd33UVZhnAA)<br>
Very detailed and relatively quick video touring one of Google's data center by Google, obviously.
This video taught me that physical data security is as important if not more than cyber security.
I think this is a must watch video for anyone in tech industry like you!

6. [Malware: Difference Between Computer Virus, Worms, and Trojan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8mbzU0X2nQ)<br>
This video explains different types of malware in a quick and simple way with some adds at the end of the video.
As a person who generalize all malware as "virus", this video really educate me on this topic.

7. [How Does Bitcoin Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Qhv8kLESY&t=315s)<br>
This video might seem unrelated to our topic about security, but if you dig deeper, you will find that Bitcoin uses Secure Hasing Algorithm - 256 (SHA-256) for the hashing process.
You can learn more about SHA-256 safety in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY&t=108s) video.
I find this video interesting because it explains almost all my questions about bitcoin and makes me comfortable enough to put my money on it, Bitcoin to the moon ðŸš€!

8. [How Does Public Key Encryption Work?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/)<br>
Short explanation on public key encryption, this article uses an easy to understand lock analogy.
For this length compare to it's information, I think this article is really worth your time.
TL;DR: public key used for encryption and private key used for decryption.

9. [What is a DDoS Attack?](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/ddos-attacks)<br>
For those who wants to build a startup, i think Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a very important topic because it's commonly used to attack online public services.
I've heard about DDoS a lot and have no idea what that is, but this article taught me a lot in just several minutes.
This article also provide a video for visual learners.

10. [2019 Internet Crime Report](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2019_IC3Report.pdf)<br>
This is a internet crime report released by FBI back in 2019, a really detailed report for statistic geeks like me.
I'm fascinated by the amount of phishing victim, I thought no one fall for that method.
Another interesting point is that the total losses grows a lot faster than the total complaints.
